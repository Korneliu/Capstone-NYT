# Capstone-NYT

This app let you search The New York Times archives by displaying articles headlines. 
Also by using advanced proprietary technology...let you filter results and
make some headlines invisible. So you are not forced to see topics which you 
don't want to see.

To build this app I used HTML/CSS/Javascript and JQuery.
